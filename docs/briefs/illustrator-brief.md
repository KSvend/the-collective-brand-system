# Illustrator Commission Brief

## "The Collective" — Ink Illustration System for Labs for Development

---

## About the Client

**Labs for Development** is a Nairobi-based organization working at the intersection of civil society, digital media, and technology for development across East Africa. Our programs span Sudan, Kenya, Egypt, and the broader East African diaspora.

Website: [labsdevelopment.org](https://www.labsdevelopment.org/)

## Scope of Work

We are commissioning a **pen-and-ink illustration system** of modular crowd figures to serve as the primary visual language across our website, publications, social media, and print materials.

**Total deliverable:** 300+ unique individual figures organized into thematic categories, plus tech overlay elements and border patterns.

---

## Style Reference

The illustration style should be inspired by **Deville (@deville.design)** — a French illustrator known for rapid ink crowd drawings using nib pen.

**Key characteristics:**
- Black ink nib pen on white paper
- Gestural strokes (each figure drawn in 10–15 seconds)
- Personality conveyed through posture, clothing, hair, and accessories
- NOT realistic portraits — emphasis on gesture and silhouette
- Expressive line weight variation from nib pressure

## Cultural Specificity Requirements

This is critical — the figures must authentically represent East African people:

### Dress & Clothing
- **Sudanese:** thobes, jallabiyas, turbans (imma), women's thobes, Western-casual mix typical of Sudanese youth in Nairobi/Cairo diaspora

### Representation

- **Disability representation:** wheelchair users, visually impaired (white cane), prosthetic users
- **Body type diversity:** varied heights, builds, postures

### Body Language
- Active, engaged postures (not passive)
- Collaborative group dynamics
- Leadership and agency in women figures

## Tech Overlay Elements

Draw these as **separate composable assets** (not attached to figures):

- Circuit-board line patterns (connectors that can run between figures)

- Data stream / binary background textures (0s and 1s flowing)
- Small device screens showing dashboards, code snippets, maps
- Gear/cog motifs
- Lightbulb motifs
- Node-and-line network diagrams

### Drawing
- **Medium:** Black ink on high-quality white paper (300gsm+)
- **Tool:** Nib pen, brush pen, or fine-tip ink pen
